# Welcome to XplainScar! 
**XplainScar is an Explainable Artificial Intelligence to Identify and Localize Left Ventricular Scar in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy from 12-lead Electrocardiogram.**

Myocardial scar in the left ventricular contributes significantly to sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). XplainScar detects left ventricular scar from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), a widely accessible alternative to MRI.
